# OOPS
This Rep contains all the concepts of OOPS in one place as a mini project of an Electronic Store.
One Stop place to clear all the OOPs concepts like

->Encapsulation:      It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.
                      Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object
                      inside a class,preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.

->Data Abstraction:  Abstraction is process of OOP where only the necessary attributes are shown.
                     Rest of the information is hidden from the instance.

->Inheritance:       Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties 
                     from another class.
                     
->Polymorphism:      The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism 
                     means the same function name (but different signatures)
                     being used for different types.
